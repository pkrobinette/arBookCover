# AR Book Cover
An augmented reality book cover for *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* by Stieg Larson. The front cover augments a 3D dragon that is shooting fire, and the back cover toggles between misc. book information and a personal book review. 

## Description of Code
This project was made using Unity and Vuforia for a MacOS build. Elements of note:
- **Scene objects** are located in `TheDragonTattoo > Assets > Scenes > BookScene`
- **Animations** are located in `TheDragonTattoo > Assets > Animations`
- The **script** used for the button element is `TheDragonTattoo > Assets > toggle`

**Note:** The BookScene would be the best place to start for customizations.


## Code Limitations
This code is meant for a MacOS with an intel64 chip. If using a different platform (e.g. Windows, Linus, iOS, Android, etc.) or processor (ARM), this build will not deploy.
